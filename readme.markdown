## TicTacToe Game
### https://apps.facebook.com/tictactoegame/

Hi,

This is a realtime, multiplayer tictactoe game for facebook.  
Major part of the code is written during the html5 hackathon organized by [5apps](https://5apps.com/) 

Proudly built with node.js, on top of express.js framework.  
Redis holds the persistent data.

On the client side backbone.js is the key, supported by socket.io for utilizing web sockets.   
Jquery is used for dom manipulation in views, benefited from jquery UI and some other jquery plugins.  
Require.js is used for module loading.

Application is live at https://apps.facebook.com/tictactoegame/  
Keep in mind that this is a multiplayer game therefore at least two players are necessary :)

Have fun,
